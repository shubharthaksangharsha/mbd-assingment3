# Findings and Debugging - Streamlit Application

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. User_id Column Inconsistency
**Issue:** Inconsistent naming and handling of the 'User_id' column across different parts of the application caused evaluation errors in Tasks B and C.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added robust column name detection to handle variant spellings (user_id, userId, userid, etc.)
- Implemented preservation of 'User_id' values before preprocessing
- Created mapping of original row indices to User_ids to restore the column after preprocessing
- Added error handling for cases where 'User_id' cannot be preserved or reconstructed

**Files Modified:**
- src/task_b/collaborative_filtering.py
- src/task_c/integration.py

### 2. Visualization Selection Reset
**Issue:** Visualization selections would reset when clicking on other UI elements, requiring users to reselect their choices.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added session state persistence for visualization selections
- Implemented unique keys for selectboxes to maintain state
- Ensured visualization choices are preserved across interface interactions

**Files Modified:**
- app.py

### 3. Deprecated Parameter Warning
**Issue:** The use of `use_column_width` parameter triggered deprecated warnings in Streamlit v1.44.1.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated all instances to use `use_container_width` instead of `use_column_width`
- Maintained backward compatibility with older Streamlit versions

**Files Modified:**
- app.py

### 4. KeyError in Recommendations Display
**Issue:** KeyErrors occurred when attempting to display recommendations that were not properly initialized or were missing expected keys.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive try-except blocks around recommendation display logic
- Implemented checking for existence of keys before attempting access
- Added user-friendly error messages when recommendations are not available

**Files Modified:**
- app.py

### 5. Association Rules Naming Inconsistency
**Issue:** Inconsistent naming between `rules` and `association_rules` attributes caused display issues in the Pattern Mining section.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated code to consistently use `association_rules` attribute
- Fixed conditional checks to properly verify the attribute's existence

**Files Modified:**
- app.py

### 6. Performance Issues with Large Datasets
**Issue:** Evaluation of recommendation methods on large user sets caused performance bottlenecks and potential timeouts.

**Fix Applied:**
- Reduced default number of users for evaluation from 20 to 5
- Added configuration options to adjust the number of users based on system capabilities
- Implemented progressive loading of results to improve responsiveness

**Files Modified:**
- run_task_c.py

### 7. Missing Value Handling
**Issue:** Large number of missing values (53,221) required special handling to prevent data loss.

**Observation:**
- 7,603 records with missing item descriptions were being removed
- This affected the quality of recommendations for some users

**Fix Applied:**
- Improved logging of missing value handling
- Added warnings when significant data is removed

**Files Modified:**
- utils/data_utils.py

### 8. Pandas SettingWithCopyWarning
**Issue:** SettingWithCopyWarning appeared when modifying date columns in dataframes.

**Observation:**
- Warnings occurred at line 1630 in app.py when setting the Date column

**Fix Required:**
- Replace direct assignment with .loc[] indexing
- Update code from `user_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(...)` to `user_data.loc[:, 'Date'] = pd.to_datetime(...)`

## Additional Findings

### 1. Pattern Mining Performance
- FP-Growth significantly outperforms Apriori on the dataset
- Processing 8,361 transactions with 167 unique items took only 0.05 seconds
- Generated 62 frequent itemsets but 0 association rules with default settings

### 2. Collaborative Filtering Metrics
- SVD model with 50 components achieved an explained variance of 0.7917
- User-based filtering evaluation showed hit rate of 0.0508 and precision of 0.0400
- Coverage (0.2156) and diversity (0.4875) metrics indicate room for improvement

### 3. Application Performance
- Streamlit v1.44.1 performs well for the application's needs
- User interface remains responsive even with complex visualizations
- Memory usage increases during pattern mining but returns to normal afterward

## Recommendations for Future Improvement

1. **Code Structure:**
   - Consolidate duplicate code in visualization sections
   - Create reusable components for common UI patterns
   - Improve error handling throughout the application

2. **Performance:**
   - Implement caching for expensive operations
   - Add progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Consider batch processing for large datasets

3. **User Experience:**
   - Add tooltips to explain metrics and configuration options
   - Implement undo/redo functionality for user actions
   - Add export options for all visualizations

4. **Data Handling:**
   - Improve strategies for dealing with missing values
   - Add data quality assessment tools
   - Implement data preprocessing options in the UI

# Findings and Debugging for Task D: Interactive Analysis

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. User_id Column Inconsistency
**Problem**: The evaluation code in Task C was encountering issues with the 'User_id' column, similar to problems previously seen in Task B.
**Analysis**: The column name was inconsistently handled across different preprocessing stages, leading to KeyError exceptions.
**Fix**: 
- Implemented robust column name checking and normalization
- Added code to detect variant spellings (user_id, userId, userid, user id, id)
- Created a mapping system to preserve User_id values during preprocessing
- Added fallback metrics when user data could not be properly matched

### 2. Association Rules Naming Inconsistency
**Problem**: The code was referencing 'rules' attribute while the actual attribute name was 'association_rules'.
**Analysis**: This inconsistency caused errors when trying to access pattern mining results.
**Fix**: Updated the code at lines 467-468 in app.py to use 'association_rules' instead of 'rules'.

### 3. Performance Issues with Large User Sets
**Problem**: The evaluation process for Task C was very slow and sometimes timed out.
**Analysis**: The default setting of evaluating 20 users was causing performance bottlenecks.
**Fix**: Reduced the number of users for evaluation from 20 to 5 to speed up the process.

### 4. Error Handling in Interactive Analysis
**Problem**: The app needed more robust error handling for edge cases.
**Analysis**: Several scenarios were not properly handled, such as:
- No association rules being found
- Pattern miner not being initialized
- Collaborative filter not being initialized
**Fix**: Added proper exception handling and user-friendly messages for these cases.
